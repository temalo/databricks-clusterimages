# Ubuntu Bionic (18.04) image 
## Azure Databricks cluster runtime image with python, scala, and Microsoft R Open

This image is intended to provide a basic Azure Databricks (I am pretty sure it can be used with AWS as well, but the image has not been tested there) that provides a databricks cluster runtime built on top of ubuntu bionic (18.04) and including python 3, Microsoft R Open, and Scala language support
